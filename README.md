Project Title: Spam and Ham Classifier using Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm

Project Description:

As a data science enthusiast, I developed a spam and ham classifier using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. 
The project aimed to classify emails/texts as either spam or ham (legitimate emails) based on their content.
The dataset used for this project consisted of emails/texts labeled as either spam or ham. After preprocessing 
the data by removing stop words, punctuation, applying tfidf, and converting all letters to lowercase,
I compared the performance of several classification algorithms including Guassian,Multinomial, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, 
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, DecssionTreeClassifier,KNeighborsClassifier,
AdaBoostClassifier, BaggingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, and GradientBoostingClassifier.
After evaluating the performance of each algorithm using metrics such as accuracy, precision, I found that the 
Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm achieved the best results, with an accuracy of 97.09% and precision_score of 1. 
The model also performed well in classifying both spam and ham emails.

The project has helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and its application 
in text classification, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of other commonly used classification algorithms. 
It has also provided me with hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in machine learning and data science and shows my passion for solving 
real-world problems using data-driven approaches.
